# Angles

This is my C++/python library of angles implemented as full featured
objects for use in astronomy applications. Constructors take degrees
(or hours in the case of right ascension), minutes and seconds. The
output operators return the same. Internally the values are converted
to a single double. Operators are overloaded to support basic
arithmatic, i.e. +, -, *, / and their inplace versions as well as the
booleans == and !=.
